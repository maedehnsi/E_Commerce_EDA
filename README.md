Unraveling some of the E-commerce App Data Analysis Challenges:

The attached file contains information about the Android app users.
1. To compare the quality of users of advertising network installations, several metrics are defined, two of which are the following:
- The percentage of users who have done at least a critical event in the app within three days after installing the app (contact_get or
) new_post_submit
- Daily return rate (retention rate) (the users above) i.e., those who have at least one event three days after installing the app
have done necessary (within 30 days after the first event after installation
For different networks, I calculated these metrics.

2. To check the presence of fraud in different network installations, I am checked these two points:
- Time distribution of installations throughout the day and night
- The distance between consecutive events of users in the app

3- Suppose the installation cost from different networks is the same. Also, each contact_get for us is 10 $, and each
submit_post_new is worth 100 $. I Compared the performance of networks in terms of the amount of value created by their installations
